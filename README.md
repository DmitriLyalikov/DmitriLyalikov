The **pico-bridge** is a project that implements an embedded RPC for interface bridging utilizing the programmable I/O peripherals on the RP2040. 
The application for the RP2040 is based on the RTIC Real Time Interrupt-Driven Concurrency environment for Rust. 
## [Man OverBoard Wearable Submersion Module](https://github.com/riverdale-soc/submersion-module)
A custom coin cell battery powered ESP32 based PCB with NEO-7M GPS module that detects submersion and propagates GPS coordinates over ESP-NOW protocol. 
Built using Altium, FreeRTOS, C, ESP-NOW and ESP-IDF
