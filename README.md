**The **pico-bridge** is a project that implements an embedded RPC for interface bridging utilizing the programmable I/O peripherals on the RP2040. 
The application for the RP2040 is based on the RTIC Real Time Interrupt-Driven Concurrency environment for Rust.**
## [Man OverBoard Wearable Submersion Module](https://github.com/riverdale-soc/submersion-module)

**A custom coin cell battery powered ESP32 based PCB with NEO-7M GPS module that detects submersion and propagates GPS coordinates over ESP-NOW protocol. 
Built using Altium, FreeRTOS, C, ESP-NOW and ESP-IDF**

## [Search and Rescue Drone for Man Overboard Victims](https://github.com/riverdale-soc/uav-mobfinder)
**Application for Jetson Nano Drone Controller to Navigate Ardupilot UAV to Man-OverBoard Victim using YOLOv7 inference on RGB and thermal camera streams. Use TensorRT to optimize inference time for CUDA GPUs.**

## [Pendant Drop Tensiometry Image Processing Application](https://github.com/DmitriLyalikov/pdt-extract)
A python implementation and library for extraction of edge profiles and characteristic features from images of pendant drops suspended from a capillary. Given a raw image of a pendant drop, the profile is extracted through a series of steps: a canny edge detection sequence, reflective noise removal, and splitting the profile at its apex.

## [Pendant Drop Tensiometry XGBoost Application](https://github.com/DmitriLyalikov/pdt_regressor)
A collection of ensemble models that predict interfacial tension (beta) from the edge profile of a pendant drop.

### Artificial Model
pdt-regressor can currently predict Beta values given a drop profile feature set with an RMSE of .004. feature datasets are currently generated by solving ODE to solve for radii of the droplet across a range of Beta and Smax values.

### Image Model
This model is also tested on a real droplet image profiles where the feature data sets are extracted from the output of the pdt-canny-edge-detector.
profile data will be stored in the /data folder in .csv format.
